"""Demonstrates automatically creating a new ShotGrid version on a publish to editorial.

This example shows how to use webhooks to listen for publishes from Flix to editorial
and automatically create a new version in ShotGrid. The new version will be linked to a sequence
and have a QuickTime exported from the Flix sequence revision attached.

The code assumes that you have attached the IDs of your ShotGrid project and sequence
to the metadata of your Flix show and sequence respectively, in the form of a ``shotgrid_id`` field.
See ``shotgrid_create_show.py`` for an example on how to do that.

Additionally, you must have registered a webhook with the Flix Server, either using
the ``/webhook`` endpoint or the ``flix webhook`` command from the Flix SDK.
The example assumes that you have registered a TCP webhook with the URL
``http://<hostname>:8888/events/shotgrid`` with the ``Publish to editorial``
event enabled.
